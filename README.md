ðŸŒŸ eCommerce Website Project ðŸŒŸ

I recently completed an exciting eCommerce website project as part of a Great Learning course. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key Features:
Sign-In/Sign-Up Form: Implemented a smooth overlay effect with CSS and JavaScript to enhance user experience.
Responsive Design: Ensured the website is fully responsive and looks great on all devices.
User-Friendly Interface: Focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface.
This project was a fantastic learning experience, and I'm proud to showcase the skills I've developed. Feel free to explore the repository and see the code in action!
